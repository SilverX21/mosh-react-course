# mosh-react-course
Learning repo for Mosh's React Course

Creating the app:
1- for this project, we will use Vite to create our application. Let's use this command:
´´´npm create vite@4.1.0´´´ -> we'll use this specific version to follow alonmg the course. Otherwise, we can use the following command: ´´´npm create vite@latest´´´
- then we will call it "react-app"
- We'll choose React and then TypeScript
